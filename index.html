I am currently a post-doctoral research fellow at <a href="http://sunnybrook.ca/" target="_blank">Sunnybrook Health Research Centre </a> and <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank"> University of Toronto</a>, where I carry out research on radiomics/quanitative imaging and lead the effort on building machine intellegent systems for computer-aided diagnosis of prostate cancer. Previously, I was a project research scientist at <a href="http://industrialskyworks.com" target="_blank">Industrial SkyWorks Inc.</a>, building computer vision and machine learnign systems for automatic anomaly detection from UAV-based thermal imaging.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Geomatics Engineering at York University, advised by Prof. Gunho Sohn. During my graduate study I've worked/interned in both academic and industrial funded projects. I obtained a M.Sc. degree in Geoinformatics from University of Twente, the Netherlands. I also hold a bachelar and a master degree from Wuhan University, China.
